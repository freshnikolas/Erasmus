      <p>
        The first day started a bit chaotic.
        Let me sum it up for you:
        <br><br>
        <ul>
          <li>- I didn't know what route to take in order to get to work</li>
          <li>- Google Maps showed me to use the trains, which would take one hour</li>
          <li>- I needed to fill up the transportation card, which Kairi gave me yesterday, in order to use the public transport</li>
          <li>- in order to fill up this card I needed to find a R-Kiosk</li>
          <li>- R-Kiosk's far away and I needed to take a Taxi for that</li>
          <li>- I filled up the card but a ticket inspector told me that this card isn't valid for regional trains</li>
          <li>- From the train station I had to walk for over half an hour</li>
          <li>- I arrived but waited at the wrong entrance for half an hour until somebody picked me up</li>
        </ul>

        <br>After this bumpy start and filling out the learning agreement I could finally start my first day at work.
        <br>My first task was to set up my work space.
        <br>First I got to build my own desk, which was still in it's original IKEA packaging waiting eagerly to be assembled.
        <br><br>After assembling the desk I needed to equip my desk with the needed hardware. 
        <br>I decided to use an old computer to set up and install Linux on it.
        <br>For this I decided to use Ubuntu and connect to it via a SSH connection.
        <br>After some hickups because of the long download time because of the slow WiFi connection, the file size limitation of FAT32 filesystems not allowing me to put the installation installation image on itself and my general inexperience installing Linux on a new system the Hardware and the OS stood ready by the end of the day for use.
        
        <br><br>After my work for the day was concluded, I drove back into the old town, this time with the bus which took only half an hour.
        <br>I realized Google Maps was showing me only train connections because of some settings I did a long time ago, which only allowed for train connections.
        <br>The day ended for me with sitting in a cafe, drinking tee and eating cake and writing work emails and filling out my report diary.
