      <p>
        The first day started off a bit chaotic.
        Let me sum it up for you:
        <ul class="pt-2 ml-2">
          <li>- I didn't know what route to take in order to get to work</li>
          <li>- Google Maps showed me to use the trains, which would take one hour</li>
          <li>- I needed to fill up the transportation card, which Kairi gave me yesterday, in order to use the public transport</li>
          <li>- in order to fill up this card I needed to find a R-Kiosk</li>
          <li>- the R-Kiosk was far away and I needed to take a Taxi for that</li>
          <li>- I filled up the card but a ticket inspector told me that this card isn't valid for regional trains</li>
          <li>- From the train station I had to walk for over half an hour</li>
          <li>- I arrived punctual but waited at the wrong entrance for half an hour until somebody picked me up</li>
        </ul>

        </div>

        After this bumpy start and filling out the learning agreement I could finally start my first day at work.
        <br>My first task was to set up my work space.
        <br>First I got to build my own desk, which was still in it's original IKEA packaging waiting eagerly to be assembled.
        
        <br><br>After assembling the desk I needed to equip my desk with the needed hardware. 
        <br>I decided to use an old computer to set up and install Linux on it.
        <br>For this I decided to use Ubuntu and connect to it via a SSH connection.
        <br>After some hickups because of the long download time because of the slow WiFi connection, the file size limitation of FAT32 filesystems not allowing me to put the installation image on itself and my general inexperience installing Linux on a new system the Hardware and the OS stood ready by the end of the day for use.
        
        <br><br>After my work for the day was concluded, I drove back into the old town, this time with the bus which took only half an hour.
        <br>I realized Google Maps was showing me only train connections because of some settings I did a long time ago, which only allowed for train connections.
        <br>The day ended for me with sitting in a cafe, drinking tee and eating cake and writing work emails and filling out my report diary.

      </div>

      <p>
        During the coming days my work at the opensource repositories of <a href="https://github.com/OpenCyphal/nunavut">Nunavut</a> and <a href="https://github.com/OpenCyphal/nunaweb">Nunaweb</a> would start.
        <br>First by reading the documentation to both of them, as they make up a substential part of the work the company I work at, does.
        <br>Nunaweb is a webapplication which is powered by Nunavut. Through those applications which compile <a href="https://opencyphal.org/">OpenCyphal DSDL</a> definitions into <a href="https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/">Jinja2</a> templates, code, schemas, metadata, documentation, etc. can be generated.
        
        <br><br>I started by downloading, installing and setting up Nunavut, <a href="https://github.com/OpenCyphal/pydsdl">pydsdl</a> and all further needed software.
        <br>In beforehand I set up a SSH connection through Visual Studio Code on my personal Laptop to the Linux PC.
        <br>That turned out to be a bigger hassle which wouldn't be worth it. Every further action will be taken directly on the Ubuntu system.
        <br>I tested if everything worked properly by cloning the <a href="https://github.com/OpenCyphal/public_regulated_data_types">public_regulated_data_types</a> repo (Repository) and generating my first documentation with the help of Nunavut, using the following command:
        
        <br><br>nnvg --experimental-languages --target-language html public_regulated_data_types/reg --lookup-dir public_regulated_data_types/uavcan
        nnvg --experimental-languages --target-language html public_regulated_data_types/uavcan

<!-- Setting up Nunaweb -->
    <section class="p-8 dark:bg-hinten-leicht_dunkel rounded-3xl">
      <div class="flex mb-5 overflow-visible">
        <div class="w-6 mr-3 bg-blau-hell"></div>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold pb-1 w-full border-b-4 border-black">Setting up Nunaweb</h2>
      </div>

      <p>
        After I installed Nunavut, I continued with setting up <a href="https://github.com/OpenCyphal/nunaweb">Nunaweb</a>.
        <br>The setup of Nunaweb is split up in two sections, the frontend and the backend.
        <br>Regardless with which you want to start you first have to clone the repo.
        <br>I started with the frontend by first swichting into the /Nunaweb directory.
        <br>Then I installed it and tried to run it by using the following comannds:

        <br><br>npm install
        <br>npm run dev

        <br><br>The backend runns with the help of Docker and Docker Compose.
        <br>Docker is an open-source platform that enables the creation, distribution, and running of applications using containers, providing a consistent and efficient environment across different systems.
        <br>Docker Compose is a tool that allows you to define and manage multi-container applications, specifying the dependencies and configuration of each container in a YAML file.
        <br>I had some difficulties with getting Docker Compose to run but after realizing I just needed to install Docker Engine, which is a platform that allows you to build, run, and manage containers and not the Docker Desktop application it finally worked.

        <br><br>The following days I would try to understand how the application works, try to fix smaller bugs regarding Nunaweb and setting up my access to github in order to push any future changes into the Nunaweb repository.

      </div>
  
      <p>
        During break time or when getting tee I had the opportunity to look at the community project of the techno campus.
        <br>K-Space is a group of young people interested in IT, electronics, retro gaming and other technical things.
        <br>They have their own chanel on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@k-space-ee">Youtube</a> in which they talk about a varriaty of technical topics.
        <br>The company I stay at is part of this community and shares their kitchen area, where I get the most important substance to stay productive during the day, my daily dose of tee.
        
        <br><br>Next to the kitchen the K-Space community has their communal room with tables, couches, 3D printers, old gmaing consoles and old PC's.
        <br>Occasionally members of K-space meet here for community activities or lan-parties.
