      <p>
        The first day started a bit chaotic.
        Let me sum it up for you:
        <br><br>
        <ul>
          <li>- I didn't know what route to take in order to get to work</li>
          <li>- Google Maps showed me to use the trains, which would take one hour</li>
          <li>- I needed to fill up the transportation card, which Kairi gave me yesterday, in order to use the public transport</li>
          <li>- in order to fill up this card I needed to find a R-Kiosk</li>
          <li>- R-Kiosk's far away and I needed to take a Taxi for that</li>
          <li>- I filled up the card but a ticket inspector told me that this card isn't valid for regional trains</li>
          <li>- From the train station I had to walk for over half an hour</li>
          <li>- I arrived but waited at the wrong entrance for half an hour until somebody picked me up</li>
        </ul>

        <br>After this bumpy start I could finally start my first day at work.
        <br>My first task was to set up my work space.
        <br>First I got to build my own desk, which was still in it's IKEA packaging 
        <br>I decided to use an old computer to set up and install Linux on it.
        <br>For this I decided to use Ubuntu and connect to it via a SSH connection.
