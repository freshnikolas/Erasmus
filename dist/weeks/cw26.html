      <p>
        The first day started off a bit chaotic.
        Let me sum it up for you:
        <br><br>
        <ul>
          <li>- I didn't know what route to take in order to get to work</li>
          <li>- Google Maps showed me to use the trains, which would take one hour</li>
          <li>- I needed to fill up the transportation card, which Kairi gave me yesterday, in order to use the public transport</li>
          <li>- in order to fill up this card I needed to find a R-Kiosk</li>
          <li>- R-Kiosk's far away and I needed to take a Taxi for that</li>
          <li>- I filled up the card but a ticket inspector told me that this card isn't valid for regional trains</li>
          <li>- From the train station I had to walk for over half an hour</li>
          <li>- I arrived but waited at the wrong entrance for half an hour until somebody picked me up</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- doesn't work -->
        <div class="relative rounded-lg text-center overflow-hidden w-5 sm:w-5 mx-auto">
          <br><img class="relative z-10 object-scale-down h-5 w-full" src="../images/cw26/cw26_1.jpg" alt="my way to work on the first day">
          <img src="../images/cw26/cw26_2.jpg" alt="my way to work on the first day">
        </div>

        <br>After this bumpy start and filling out the learning agreement I could finally start my first day at work.
        <br>My first task was to set up my work space.
        <br>First I got to build my own desk, which was still in it's original IKEA packaging waiting eagerly to be assembled.
        
        <br><br>After assembling the desk I needed to equip my desk with the needed hardware. 
        <br>I decided to use an old computer to set up and install Linux on it.
        <br>For this I decided to use Ubuntu and connect to it via a SSH connection.
        <br>After some hickups because of the long download time because of the slow WiFi connection, the file size limitation of FAT32 filesystems not allowing me to put the installation image on itself and my general inexperience installing Linux on a new system the Hardware and the OS stood ready by the end of the day for use.
        
        <br><br>After my work for the day was concluded, I drove back into the old town, this time with the bus which took only half an hour.
        <br>I realized Google Maps was showing me only train connections because of some settings I did a long time ago, which only allowed for train connections.
        <br>The day ended for me with sitting in a cafe, drinking tee and eating cake and writing work emails and filling out my report diary.

    </div>

    <p>
      During the coming days my work at the opensource repositories of <a href="https://github.com/OpenCyphal/nunavut">Nunavut</a> and <a href="https://github.com/OpenCyphal/nunaweb">Nunaweb</a> would start.
      <br>First by reading the documentation to both of them, as they make up a substential part of the work the company I work at, does.
      <br>Nunaweb is a webapplication which is powered by Nunavut. Through those applications which compile <a href="https://opencyphal.org/">OpenCyphal DSDL</a> definitions into <a href="https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/">Jinja2</a> templates, code, schemas, metadata, documentation, etc. can be generated.
      
      <br><br>I started by downloading, installing and setting up Nunavut, <a href="https://github.com/OpenCyphal/pydsdl">pydsdl</a> and all further needed software.
      <br>In beforehand I set up a SSH connection through Visual Studio Code on my personal Laptop to the Linux PC.
      <br>That turned out to be a bigger hassle which wouldn't be worth it. Every further action will be taken directly on the Ubuntu system.
      <br>I tested if everything worked properly by cloning the <a href="https://github.com/OpenCyphal/public_regulated_data_types">public_regulated_data_types</a> repo (Repository) and generating my first documentation with the help of Nunavut, using the following command:
      <br><br>nnvg --experimental-languages --target-language html public_regulated_data_types/reg --lookup-dir public_regulated_data_types/uavcan
      nnvg --experimental-languages --target-language html public_regulated_data_types/uavcan
