      <p>
        Finally the day arrvied, everything is packed, I arrive early enough, a last goodbye to my loved ones and... 
        <br>My flight has a delay.
        <br>But after I listened to some music for thirty more minutes, the plane was ready to be boarded.
        <br><br>After two further hours I left my homeland 1000km behind me and stood in Estonia's capital.
        <br>I tried not to waste too much time, after all it was 20:00 o'clock and Kairi, the person responsible for me during my time in Estonia, was waiting for me outside.
        <br>She greeted me warmly and in the car we talked about the city, pending matters for me and my German roomate Stephan and further plans for the week. 
        <br><br>After we arrived at the apartment and Stephan and me greet each other we were left alone.
        <br>Pressed by hunger and curiosity I was eager to leave the apartment and go on a small expedition in the old town, concluding my day in Berlin fashion with a Kebab.

<!-- Why Estonia? -->
    <section class="p-8 dark:bg-hinten-leicht_dunkel rounded-3xl">
      <div class="flex mb-5 ">
        <div class="w-6 mr-3 bg-blau-hell"></div>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold pb-1 w-2/5 border-b-4 border-black">Why Estonia?</h2>
      </div>

      <p>
        Due to startup-friendly regulations Estonia has built up a reputation for beeing a good place to create a company.
        <br>Over the years many new small and innovative companies were founded in Estonia and today it hosts the most startups per capita in Europe.
        <br><br>This is helped by the fact, that you are able to become an e-citizen by signing in online on the official Estonian website.
        <br>Doing taxes, booking an doctors appointment or identifying yourself is beeing streamlined and digitalized.
        <br>All of this leads to a sentiment of optimism, change and witnessing the formation of a new modern society.
        
        <br><br>Furthermore it is the farthest north I have ever been.
        <br>Even though I planned on visiting Sweden I am very happy with my choice.
        <br>The country has enough beautifull nature to offer and Tallinn is an interesting city.
        <br>Should I be bored with the capital, Riga in Latvia and Helsinki in Finnaland are up to a four hours drive away.
