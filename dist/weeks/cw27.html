      </div>

      <p>
        Before I could start working on a new project, I had first to do some fixing regarding errors that were made during the Nunaweb installation and setup process in the previous week.
        After that I recieved several small tasks, such as fixing wrong indents which were caused by a faulty html skript generation or missing API-keys for the html subriectories which were generated on a offical server.
        <br>For the missing API-keys I did several small tests over the day, which included:
        <ul class="pt-2 pl-2">
          <li>- Tested if error occurred if error was generated locally and not on the server
            <li class="pl-4">-> error did not occur</li>
          </li>
          <li>- Error message showed that the key should lie under docs/uavcan/uavcan but this directory was deleted after a successful generation</li>
          <li>- Locally it worked
            <li class="pl-4">-> No API is beeing called into action because everything is beeing done locally</li>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-right pt-1 italic text-sm">my work space</p>

        <br>Soon we realized that fixing those small problems required an update of the Nunavut version inside of Nunaweb, which would be my next task for the week.

<!-- Updating Nunaweb -->
    <section class="p-8 dark:bg-hinten-leicht_dunkel rounded-3xl">
      <div class="flex mb-5 overflow-visible">
        <div class="w-6 mr-3 bg-blau-hell"></div>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold pb-1 w-full border-b-4 border-black">Updating Nunaweb</h2>
      </div>

      <p>
        Updating Nunaweb required the rewirting of some modules, espacially the <a href="https://github.com/OpenCyphal/nunaweb/blob/main/nunaserver/nunaserver/generator.py">_generators.py</a> inside of Nunaweb.
        <br>The steps I took during this week go as follows:
        <ul class="pt-2 pl-2">
          <li>- Fixing the version of python which is beeing used for this project (changed from newest to python 3.9)</li>
          <li>- Corrected imports for _generators.py</li>
          <li>- fixed the initialization of several methods and their arguments</li>
          <li>- rewirting parts of the def _generate_dsdl method</li>
        </ul>
        
        <br>At the end of the week I still haven't managed to get the newest version of Nunavut inside of Nunaweb running.
