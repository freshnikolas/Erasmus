    There are some things that change in life. Maybe you switch companies, travel to a different town, lose and meet new friends.
    <br>But then there is Nunaweb. Nunaweb is constant. Nunaweb won't leave you alone... Never.
    <br>The changes I worked on got approved last week but now the deploy of the GitHub workflow failed.
    Throughout the week I tried to get it running but for now the deployment failes when trying to pull several of the needed containers.

    <br><br>On the other hand, on monday Kairi and Mr. Döbler visited me during work and together with the epmloyees of Zubax, we talked about the goals of the company and about the goals of the OSZ IMT organizing this vocational training abroad.
    After the two parties got to know each other and after exchanging contacts they left, but we wouldn't be seperated for long, as Mr. Döbler, Stephan and me would meet on the next day in restaurant.
    <br>We had really nice talks, first about our experiences regarding the current and further international vocational trainings, but later on about many more diverse topics. So many in fact I would need a cold beverage to list them all. :)
  
    <br><br>Because of cramps I switched my mouse with an old model, which needed a mouse pad.
    Because we hadn't any left I decided to build one myself using a cardboard that was laying around.
    <br>Maybe I can make a buisness out of this?

<!-- Experimentation with a vacuum sealer -->

  <p>
    In the middle of the week a new and very heavy package arrived at our office ny colleagues started to unbox.
    <br>I do envy them. There are very vew things in life I like more than unpacking technichal products.
    <br>Soon they revealed a new vacuum sealing machine.
    
    <br><br>The company works on a prototype of a magnet, which can be controlled via a wire coil, creating an elektromagnetic force.
    On this magnet an epoxy layer needs to be molded onto.
    <br>The reason for aquiring that machine is, that this epoxy layer is full of air bubbles which make the stucture briddle and prone for instability.
    By pouring the epoxy on the magnet inside a vacuum the air bubbles should get sucked out, fixing the problem.

<!-- A car-centric society -->
<section class="p-8 bg-gray-800 shadow-md hover:shadow-lg shadow-black hover:shadow-blau-dunkel rounded-3xl">
  <div class="flex mb-5 overflow-visible">
    <div class="w-6 mr-3 bg-blau-hell"></div>
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold pb-1 w-full border-b-4 border-black">A car-centric society</h2>
  </div>

  <p>
    Over the weeks I noticed, that Tallinn is a very car centric city.
    There a very few bycicle paths and if there are any, they are not planned and taken care of well.
    often byciclists have to ride next to cars and trucks that pass them by within a couple of centimeters and with 50 km/h or faster.
    <br><br>
    Then there are the streets in general which are very wide, often between 6 to 8 lanes, with lights which heavily favor car drivers with their timing.
    Often you have to stand for at least one or several minutes to pass a wide street, or a wide street with an island in between doesn't allow you to cross the street in one go because of the short timing.

    <br><br><img class="object-cover rounded-lg md:h-96 pb-6" src="../images/cw30/carcent1.jpg" alt="road ending abruptly"></img>
    
    Slip lanes are very common as well (which favor cars and trade in the safety of the pedestrians and cyclists) and places which shouldn't allow cars, like the old town are mostly not restricted for motorized vehicles.
    Card drivers are not gurrentied to stop at a pedestrian crossing, so please watch out!
    The public transport is filled with busses, but only very vew tram lines and no trains or subway.
    With 200.000 more residents, Helsinki has every of those transport possibilities. 

    <br><br><img class="object-cover rounded-lg md:h-96 pb-6" src="../images/cw30/carcent2.jpg" alt="street without walkway for pedestrians"></img>

    Often sidewalks are not well maintained, too small, end abruptly or are nonexistent in the first place.

    <div class="columns-1 md:columns-2 pt-6">
      <img class="object-cover rounded-lg md:h-96 pb-6" src="../images/cw30/carcent4.jpg" alt="walkway too narrow for pedestrian">
      <img class="object-cover rounded-lg md:h-96 pb-6" src="../images/cw30/carcent3.jpg" alt="street without walkway for pedestrians"></img>
    </div>
    Even though the city has around 400.000 residents it is filled with a massive car infrastructure that is used by very many people.
    If you are a person who in term likes driving everywhere and likes the constant sound of cars, no matter where he goes, you will feel at the right place (especially because many cars are tuned and incredibly loud because of the lack of regulations).
    <br><br>
    For me, this is a massive downside and a missed opportunity of many post-soviet countries which are rapidly developing. 
    Just like in Poland (a counry I know pretty well) car centric design is beeing used extensivly, making life in those cities less pleasent.
